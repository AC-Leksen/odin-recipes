    <h1>Baked Churro Bites</h1>

    <p>These are very close to the regular deep fried churros. Serve with hot chocolate, or dipped in a chocolate sauce.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You hear people say that churro dough is identical to the ubiquitous “pate choux,” but I don’t agree. 
        If you do use that classic French dough, you’ll get something that’s lighter, eggier, and much more hollow. 
        So, I’ve tweaked the proportions to get something a little denser, and I think closer to a “real” churro. 
        By the way, stay tuned for the Spanish-style hot chocolate, which will be the next video. 
        But, no matter how you decide to enjoy yours, I really hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
