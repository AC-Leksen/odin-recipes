Odin recipes project

This is my first "real" html project from The Odin Project curriculum.
The objective is to create the barebones of a website, with a home page 
containing links to different pages with respective recipes.
The exercise is meant to apply and memorize the usage of images, 
links and lists, apart from the usual html boilerplate.
